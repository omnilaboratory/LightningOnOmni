OBD implements the [OmniBOLT](https://github.com/omnilaboratory/OmniBOLT-spec) specification, and it is an open source, off-chain decentralized platform, build upon BTC/OmniLayer network, implements basic multi hop HTLC payment, multi-currency atomic swap, and more off-chain contracts on the network of [smart assets lightning channels](https://github.com/omnilaboratory/OmniBOLT-spec/blob/master/OmniBOLT-02-peer-protocol.md#omni-address).

In addition, OBD is designed special for inbound liquidity providers. A daemon allows thousands of remote light clients connections, including connections from [LND wallets](https://omnilaboratory.github.io/obd/#/Architecture?id=lnd-integrated). 

Clone, compile the source code and run the binary executable file, you will have a featured OmniBOLT deamon(OBD) to start the journey of lightning network.
