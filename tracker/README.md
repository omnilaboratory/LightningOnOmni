The introduction and architecture of tracker network is [here](https://omnilaboratory.github.io/obd/#/Architecture?id=tracker-network).  

## Minimum system requirement

https://omnilaboratory.github.io/obd/#/OBD-README?id=installation-and-minimum-system-requirement

* 4.0 GHz 64-bit processor
* 16 GB memory
* 500 GB HDD(SSD would be better) for a btc/omnicore full node
* Ubuntu 14.04.4 LTS or later
* golang 1.10 or later


## Install Omnicore

[Install the omnicore from the project repository](https://github.com/OmniLayer/omnicore#installation) . After the installation is complete, the user needs to wait for a while to synchronize the full node data. 

## Config tracker

Open `tracker/config/conf.ini`, edit the omnicore address, username and password:

```
host = the omnicore ip address, for example: 62.234.216.108:18332
user = the user name
pass = the password
```

Omnicore has a whitelist, only the ip on the list can access it. We suggest user to run tracker and omnicore on the same device. A constant online cloud server is advised. 


## Run tracker

```
./tracker_server
```
