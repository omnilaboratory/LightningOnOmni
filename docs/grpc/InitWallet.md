## initWallet

InitWallet is used when obd(lnd,oblnd) is starting up for the first time to fully initialize the daemon and its internal wallet. At the very least a wallet password must be provided. This will be used to encrypt sensitive material on disk.
In the case of a recovery scenario, the user can also specify their aezeed mnemonic and passphrase. If set, then the daemon will use this prior state to initialize its internal wallet.
Alternatively, this can be used along with the GenSeed RPC to obtain a seed, then present it to the user. Once it has been verified by the user, the seed can be fed into this RPC in order to commit the new wallet. 

## Arguments:
| Field		   |	gRPC Type		|	   Description  |
| -------- 	 |	---------   |    ---------    |  
| wallet_password	     |	bytes		  |	      wallet_password is the passphrase that should be used to encrypt the wallet. This MUST be at least 8 chars in length. After creation, this password is required to unlock the daemon. When using REST, this field must be encoded as base64.|  
| cipher_seed_mnemonic   |	string[]		  |   cipher_seed_mnemonic is a 24-word mnemonic that encodes a prior aezeed cipher seed obtained by the user. This may have been generated by the GenSeed method, or be an existing seed.| 
| aezeed_passphrase      |  bytes             |   aezeed_passphrase is an optional user provided passphrase that will be used to encrypt the generated aezeed cipher seed. When using REST, this field must be encoded as base64.|
| recovery_window      |  int             |   recovery_window is an optional argument specifying the address lookahead when restoring a wallet seed. The recovery window applies to each individual branch of the BIP44 derivation paths. Supplying a recovery window of zero indicates that no addresses should be recovered, such after the first initialization of the wallet.|
| channel_backups      |  ChanBackupSnapshot |   channel_backups is an optional argument that allows clients to recover the settled funds within a set of channels. This should be populated if the user was unable to close out all channels and sweep funds before partial or total data loss occurred. If specified, then after on-chain recovery of funds, obd(lnd,oblnd) begin to carry out the data loss recovery protocol in order to recover the funds in each channel from a remote force closed transaction.|
| stateless_init      |  string                |   stateless_init is an optional argument instructing the daemon NOT to create any *.macaroon files in its filesystem. If this parameter is set, then the admin macaroon returned in the response MUST be stored by the caller of the RPC as otherwise all access to the daemon will be lost!|
| extended_master_key      |  bool             |  extended_master_key is an alternative to specifying cipher_seed_mnemonic and aezeed_passphrase. Instead of deriving the master root key from the entropy of an aezeed cipher seed, the given extended master root key is used directly as the wallet's master key. This allows users to import/use a master key from another wallet. When doing so, obd(lnd,oblnd) still uses its default SegWit only (BIP49/84) derivation paths and funds from custom/non-default derivation paths will not automatically appear in the on-chain wallet. Using an 'xprv' instead of an aezeed also has the disadvantage that the wallet's birthday is not known as that is an information that's only encoded in the aezeed, not the xprv. Therefore a birthday needs to be specified in extended_master_key_birthday_timestamp or a "safe" default value will be used.|
| extended_master_key_birthday_timestamp      |  int                |   extended_master_key_birthday_timestamp is the optional unix timestamp in seconds to use as the wallet's birthday when using an extended master key to restore the wallet. obd(lnd,oblnd) will only start scanning for funds in blocks that are after the birthday which can speed up the process significantly. If the birthday is not known, this should be left at its default value of 0 in which case obd(lnd,oblnd) will start scanning from the first SegWit block (481824 on mainnet).|
| watch_only      |  WatchOnly                |   watchonly is the third option of initializing a wallet: by importing account xpubs only and therefore creating a watch-only wallet that does not contain any private keys. That means the wallet won't be able to sign for any of the keys and _needs to be run with a remote signer that has the corresponding private keys and can serve signing RPC requests.|
| macaroon_root_key      |  bytes                |   macaroon_root_key is an optional 32 byte macaroon root key that can be provided when initializing the wallet rather than letting obd(lnd,oblnd) generate one on its own.|
